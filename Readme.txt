The process started with choosing a theme and idea to build around.
I went with a halloween theme as it's right around the corner and I thought it would be nice to have a gallery to show responsiveness as well as following the wireframe given.
The process was fairly easy, but I would say that is largely due to my reliance on already familiar processes.
While bootstrap was fairly easy to get started and understand, I find that for minute details and certain implementations, the prebuilt classes can be a bit unaccomodating. 
I think in the future, I will try tailwind and see how that works out.

As someone who knows that they are not good at UX and any sort of graphical design, my plan was simple.
Create a product that maybe doesn't look the best, but has enough substance to show 'competence' and engage users through fun. Which is one of my personal values.
I think we could all use a bit more whimsy and laughs in our lives.
And to that extent, I think the product satisfied its purpose.

Css positioning and sizing I think will be something I will always have a bit of trouble with, I find containers and alignment somewhat unintuitive.
But this I'm sure,  will lessen with time and familiarity.
